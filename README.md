# Botania-PE
An MCPE Native Mod/Addon open Source Code, this should only be run by BL at the moment.
This mod was origanally made on PC by Vazkii (@vazkii)
This mod was originally ported by KingbudderJr (@kingbudderjr), then Given to Darkserver (@pierce_manasseh)

# How to Build:
To build the mod into an apk file, you need to have AIDE app installed on your android phone or an android IDK on your PC. When you have it on your android or PC, you need to have also the Native Development Kit installed. When the NDK has been installed, you can now run and build the APK with the software, the way to build the apk depends on the software, so make sure you know how to use it. :)
